## ⏱️ Propagation Time

With Cloudflare, DNS changes are typically:
- **Immediate to 5 minutes** (for most users)
- **Maximum: 1-2 hours** (globally)

Much faster than standard DNS! ⚡

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### Immediate Check (After saving):

**1. Check in Cloudflare:**
- Your DNS page should show the new A record (75.2.60.5)
- Old GitHub IPs should be gone

**2. Clear DNS cache on your computer:**
```powershell
ipconfig /flushdns
```

**3. Check DNS resolution:**
```powershell
nslookup uditaranade.com
```

Should show: `75.2.60.5` (not 185.199.x.x)

**4. Wait 5-10 minutes, then test in browser:**
- Open: https://uditaranade.com
- Should show your website (not 404)
- Try incognito mode: Ctrl+Shift+N

**5. Check globally:**
- Visit: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/uditaranade.com
- Should show `75.2.60.5` worldwide

## 🔒 Cloudflare SSL/TLS Settings

After DNS is updated:

### In Cloudflare Dashboard:
1. Go to **SSL/TLS** section
2. Set **SSL/TLS encryption mode** to:
   - ✅ **"Full (strict)"** - Most secure (recommended)
   - Or **"Full"** - Also works

3. Enable these options:
   - ✅ Always Use HTTPS
   - ✅ Automatic HTTPS Rewrites
   - ✅ Opportunistic Encryption

---

## 🎯 Netlify Configuration

After DNS changes propagate:

1. Go to Netlify: https://app.netlify.com/sites/uditaranade/settings/domain
2. Click **"Retry DNS verification"** button
3. Wait for SSL certificate to provision (automatic)
4. Status should change to: ✅ "Netlify DNS is set up correctly"

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still seeing 404 after changes?

**1. Clear browser cache:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- Clear cached images and files
- Or use Incognito mode: `Ctrl + Shift + N`

**2. Clear DNS cache:**
```powershell
ipconfig /flushdns
```

**3. Check DNS propagation:**
```powershell
nslookup uditaranade.com
```

Should show: `75.2.60.5`

**4. Check Cloudflare proxy status:**
- In Cloudflare DNS, ensure orange cloud 🟠 is ON
- This enables Cloudflare's CDN + DDoS protection

**5. Temporarily disable Cloudflare proxy (if issues persist):**
- In DNS records, click the orange cloud 🟠
- It will turn gray ☁️ (DNS only)
- This bypasses Cloudflare temporarily
- Wait 5 minutes and test
- If works, you can re-enable orange cloud

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Cloudflare Users

1. **Proxy Status (Orange Cloud):**
   - 🟠 **ON (Proxied)** = Cloudflare CDN + Security + Caching
   - ☁️ **OFF (DNS Only)** = Direct to Netlify, no Cloudflare features
   - **Recommended:** Keep it ON (orange) for best performance

2. **SSL Certificate:**
   - Netlify will automatically provision SSL via Let's Encrypt
   - Cloudflare also provides SSL
   - Together = Double SSL protection! 🔒

3. **Caching:**
   - Cloudflare caches your site automatically
   - To clear cache: Cloudflare dashboard → Caching → Purge Everything

4. **Page Rules (Optional):**
   - You can set up redirects (www → non-www or vice versa)
   - Force HTTPS redirects
   - Cache rules

---

## 🎉 Expected Result

Once DNS is configured correctly:

✅ https://uditaranade.com → Your website loads  
✅ https://www.uditaranade.com → Your website loads (if CNAME added)  
✅ Automatic HTTPS with SSL certificate  
✅ Fast loading via Cloudflare + Netlify CDN  
✅ DDoS protection from Cloudflare  
✅ No more 404 errors
