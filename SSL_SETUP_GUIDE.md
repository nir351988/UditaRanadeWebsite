# 🔒 SSL Certificate Setup Guide

## Current Status

**Domain:** uditaranade.com  
**DNS:** ✅ Configured correctly (75.2.60.5)  
**SSL:** ⏳ Pending provisioning  
**Website:** ✅ Loading (but showing "Not secure")

---

## Why SSL is Not Active Yet

1. **DNS was just updated** - You changed DNS from GitHub Pages to Netlify
2. **Netlify needs time** to verify DNS ownership
3. **Let's Encrypt provisioning** takes 2-10 minutes after verification
4. **Global propagation** - DNS might still be updating worldwide

---

## ✅ How to Activate SSL (Manual - Fastest)

### Step 1: Go to Netlify Dashboard
**URL:** https://app.netlify.com/sites/uditaranade/settings/domain

### Step 2: Scroll to "HTTPS" Section
Look for the HTTPS/SSL section on that page

### Step 3: Click "Verify DNS configuration"
- There should be a button that says "Verify DNS configuration" or "Retry DNS verification"
- Click it to trigger DNS verification

### Step 4: Provision Certificate
- Once DNS is verified, click "Provision certificate" or "Renew certificate"
- This will request an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt

### Step 5: Wait 2-5 Minutes
- Netlify will contact Let's Encrypt
- Certificate will be issued automatically
- Page will show "Certificate active" with a green checkmark

## ⏰ Timeline

| Action | Time |
|--------|------|
| DNS verification | Instant to 5 minutes |
| Certificate request | 1-2 minutes |
| Certificate activation | 2-5 minutes |
| **Total time** | **5-10 minutes** |

## 🔍 What to Look For in Netlify

### Before SSL:
```
⚠️ Domain: uditaranade.com
   DNS verification failed
   [Retry DNS verification] button
```

### After DNS Verification:
```
✅ Domain: uditaranade.com
   DNS is correctly configured
   [Provision certificate] button
```

### After SSL Provisioning:
```
✅ Domain: uditaranade.com
   Certificate active
   🔒 HTTPS enabled
```

## 🎯 Alternative: Cloudflare SSL (Immediate)

Since you're using Cloudflare, you can enable immediate HTTPS:

### In Cloudflare Dashboard:

1. **Go to:** https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. **Select:** uditaranade.com
3. **Click:** SSL/TLS (in left menu)
4. **Set encryption mode:**
   - Select **"Flexible"** for immediate HTTPS (less secure)
   - Or **"Full"** once Netlify SSL is active (more secure)
   - Or **"Full (strict)"** for maximum security (best)

### Cloudflare SSL Modes Explained:

| Mode | Description | Requirement |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Off** | No HTTPS | N/A |
| **Flexible** | Browser → Cloudflare = HTTPS<br>Cloudflare → Netlify = HTTP | Works immediately |
| **Full** | Browser → Cloudflare = HTTPS<br>Cloudflare → Netlify = HTTPS | Need Netlify SSL |
| **Full (strict)** | Full + validates certificate | Need Netlify SSL |

### Quick Fix with Cloudflare:

1. Set SSL/TLS to **"Flexible"** mode
2. Your site will show HTTPS immediately
3. Later, change to **"Full (strict)"** when Netlify SSL is ready

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Check SSL Status in Browser:
```
Before: 🔓 Not secure | uditaranade.com
After:  🔒 Secure | https://uditaranade.com
```

### 2. Check SSL Certificate:
```powershell
# PowerShell command to check SSL
curl.exe -I https://uditaranade.com 2>&1 | Select-String "SSL|Server"
```

### 3. Online SSL Checker:
- Visit: https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html
- Enter: uditaranade.com
- Should show: "Certificate is valid"

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "DNS verification failed"

**Solution:**
1. Wait 5-10 more minutes for DNS to propagate
2. Clear your DNS cache: `ipconfig /flushdns`
3. Check DNS globally: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/uditaranade.com
4. Ensure it shows `75.2.60.5` worldwide

### Issue: "Certificate provisioning failed"

**Solution:**
1. Check Cloudflare proxy status (should be orange 🟠 or gray ☁️)
2. Try turning Cloudflare proxy OFF temporarily (gray cloud)
3. Retry certificate provisioning in Netlify
4. Once provisioned, turn Cloudflare proxy back ON

### Issue: Still showing "Not secure" after 24 hours

**Solution:**
1. Go to Cloudflare → SSL/TLS → Set to "Flexible"
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Test: https://uditaranade.com
4. Once Netlify SSL is active, change to "Full (strict)"

## 🎯 Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (5 minutes):
1. ✅ Go to Netlify dashboard (link opened)
2. ✅ Click "Verify DNS configuration"
3. ✅ Click "Provision certificate"
4. ⏳ Wait 2-5 minutes

### Temporary Solution (If urgent):
1. ✅ Go to Cloudflare → SSL/TLS
2. ✅ Set mode to "Flexible"
3. ✅ Site will show HTTPS immediately
4. ⏳ Later upgrade to "Full (strict)"

### Best Practice (After Netlify SSL active):
1. ✅ Netlify SSL certificate: Active
2. ✅ Cloudflare SSL mode: "Full (strict)"
3. ✅ Force HTTPS: Enabled in Netlify
4. ✅ HSTS: Enabled (optional)

## ✅ Expected Final Result

Once SSL is active:
- ✅ https://uditaranade.com → Secure 🔒
- ✅ https://www.uditaranade.com → Secure 🔒
- ✅ http://uditaranade.com → Redirects to HTTPS
- ✅ Browser shows padlock icon
- ✅ Certificate: Let's Encrypt (valid 90 days, auto-renewed)
- ✅ Encryption: TLS 1.2 or 1.3
